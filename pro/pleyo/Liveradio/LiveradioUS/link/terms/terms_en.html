receive applicable royalties, this software identifies and counts the
songs you have accessed. At the aggregate level (i.e., not tied to
the personal information of any user), we use this data to report and
pay royalties, for internal analysis and we share this data with
certain Partners for their own analysis. We do not share your
personal usage data with any third parties. We may use your personal
usage data for a variety of Service-related purposes including,
