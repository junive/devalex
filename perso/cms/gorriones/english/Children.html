<div>Margarys oldest sister, guardian of her 4 younger brothers and sisters, brought her sister to the house. Their parents were alcoholics and both died one quickly after the other. Margarys brothers also live in orphanages. Before coming to the house, Margary had never left her parents house and she had never been to school. She never experienced her parents love and they didnt bring her up. Margary is mentally handicapped and she has trouble speaking. At first, nobody could understand what she said and she was very frightened of men. She used to hide her toys because she didnt know how to play with them. Now she goes to school with Sabina. Margary is always cheerful, she laughs a lot and likes playing with the younger children and the volunteers. She helps a lot in the cuarto de Lupes. Sometimes she doesnt know when to stop teasing, because she doesnt know the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. She liked dancing, volleyball, and she is very energetic.</div></font></div></div></td></tr>

<div>Noémie (or Mimi) came to the house with chronic malnutrition. She was hardly able to walk properly. Her mother had lost her whole family during the period of terrorism in the region and had grown up with adoptive parents. Seriously traumatized, Mimis mother used to live on the streets more than at home. At 15 she became pregnant  Mimis older sister lives in another home. Now her mother has had a third child and Mimi lives in the house. Working with Mimi calls for a lot of patience, but she is delightful. You have to watch out because the other children reject her. Her smile is precious. She loves learning new things, and likes adult attention. She loves it when volunteers that she knows well help her get dressed. She also loves jigsaw puzzles; drawing ... she needs to be stimulated to work on her balance. More than most, Mimi is a cheerful child.</div></font></div></div></td></tr>

Sometimes he teases the younger children, like Alonso, and makes them cry. When there is a meeting he always behaves like a very understanding boy, and apologizes for the upset he has caused himself and the other children, but the question is does his behaviour ever really change?</font></div></div></div></td></tr>

The children regularly visited their father in prison. It was very important that they kept in touch with him. Now, Juan Carlos and Elmer live at URPI, the state-run orphanage for boys aged 6-18; Emerson chose to stay at the house. Now their father is free and lives in the jungle. The brothers will prorably go and live with him again. Emerson is one of the oldest boys in the house. He likes playing football, riding his bike, and playing in the garden.

He likes playing with his cars and toys, and he loves animals. He is also best friends with Fermín. Alberto is a kind boy, especially towards Gil and Chantal, but he can also be very difficult.

Their father comes twice a month and hopes that when they are older theyll be able to go and live with him. Working with Freddy requires a lot of patience. He doesnt like sharing his toys, and when another child is playing too, Freddy always wants the others toy. He often cries for nothing, and the best thing is to leave him to calm down on his own, or to make him laugh by doing something completely different, because if youre too strict, that just makes him cry more. When hes in a good mood, he plays nicely. Hes very empathic and always asks how you are. He loves cuddles.</div></font></td></tr>

<div>Sabina is 20, and she is the oldest girl in the house. She is hard of hearing and has a mild mental handicap. We dont know much about her past. She was found on the streets of Lima when she was 10. Then she was employed as a cleaner in a house and was often very badly treated. 4 years later she was ended up at the family court because the woman Sabina worked for wanted to move house and couldnt emply her anymore. She came to Ayacucho and to the house. In the mornings Sabina goes to a special school and in the afternoons she helps at the house. She has started to speak a little bit. Sabina is a responsible girl, calm, and very nice. She helps the lupes a lot and in the kitchen. She gets on very well with Francine and she helps her makes cakes. Sabina likes knitting. Shell probably always stay at the house as this has now become her home.</div></font></div></div></td></tr>

His adoptive mother then died and then he was brought to the house. Eberson is blind and has a cerebral palsy. He goes for therapy 3 times a week. They help him to walk a bit, and are hoping that hell be able to do this on his own soon. He needs a lot of love and attention. He very affectionate and smiles a lot, but sometimes he can be very aggressive, and when hes not happy, he bangs his head on the floor. He loves playing with a ball and can spend hours listening to music and loves being taken for walks by volunteers, in a manta on their backs. He is on the adoption list.</div></font>

The 4 youngest children live in the house, another boy lives in La Casa de Willy, and the oldest boy lives with his father in the jungle. When Luis Alonso came to the house he had several serious illnesses  anemia, malaria, hepatitis. He also suffered from serious malnutrition, and even now he still has phsychological problems. It was very difficult for the 2 brothers to accept their mothers death and the separation from their other brothers. At the beginning, they refused to have any contact with their father. Now their father and older brothers come to visit when they can. The 4 children also spend holidays with their father, grandmother, and brothers in the jungle.

<div>Fermin arrived at the house in April 2007 when he was 8. Hes a very special child; even though hes 8 years old, he has a mental age of 3. He is mentally handicapped, caused by violence, but his parents are also mentally handicapped. During the first 6 years of his life, Fermin lived with his mother. However, according to his aunt, his mother didnt know what to do with him and locked him in a room for 6 years, depriving him of clothes and food. Fermin was found one cold and rainy day in a corner of a dark lane, he was very dirty, just wearing a jumper, bare feet, and seriously malnourished. Hed been so hungry that hed even eaten his own excrement. Working with Fermin demands a lot of concentration and patience. Lots of things that Fermin does dont seem to make any sense. When he arrived at the house, Fermin was hyperactive, used to bite and hit others sometimes ... He regularly ignored what people said to him. But as we didnt know his level of mental handicap, it was difficult to know how much his behaviour was the result of his illness or of the violence he suffered when he was little. Twice a week Fermin goes for therapy. In November 2007, two volunteers created a treatment plan for Fermin, with activities to stimulate him and to help control his aggressive attitude. The work they have done shows that Fermin is capable of understanding and doing things asked of him. It is important for his development that this work with him follows a strict routine, and he will get used to doing basic activities in normal daily life - washing his hands, brushing his teeth, getting dressed, etc. Its also important to treat Fermin like a normal child, and for him to mix as much as possible with the other children. You have to be careful as others might hit him. Fermin loves kisses, looking people in the eye, little bits of paper, water and merry-go-rounds.</div></font></td></tr>

Now he does daily exercises, physical therapy to stimulate his arms and legs, especially his right hand that he still never uses. Not long ago he said his first word: GRACIAS and has managed to walk 4 steps and is beginning to walk on his own. Hes an alert child, a happy baby, with a strong character.
